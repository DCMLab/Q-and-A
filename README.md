# DCML Q&A

There is a bunch of questions or objection related to our work that come up repeatedly and we would all more or less give the same answer over and over again. This page collects these questions and answers to that we can point people here instead of bothering with explaining them the stuff yet again ;-)

## Computers and Music: How should that ever go together?

### Computers are deterministic machines that are preprogramed to to what they were told to. Music lives from emotions and (especially in the case of imporvisation) from spontaneity and creativity.
